The Plot:

An high school who is font of cars are racing, who always get into trouble because of the same. His parents got divorced when he was three and he is currently staying with his Mom in US while Father works in the navy and is posted in Tokyo, Japan. The Mom and Son had relocated several times to escape from the judicial consequences of the leading character's behaviour. After an incident happened at school where he got himself into an accident during a race and had damaged several properties, his mom decide to sent him to his father at Tokyo.


There he meets Han and the villain in the story. Our leading character who is not familiar with drifts loses to the villain. The movie is about how han teaches him how to drift and how he wins at the end. Though the movie has awesome and touching dialogues and many exciting racing performances, it was not upto the mark of the other fast and furious movies. The story was not strong as well as there weren't much sense in racing for all the things which was not in the case of its earlier sequels.
