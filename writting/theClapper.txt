Review:

The movie revolves around Eddie Krumble (Ed Helms) who used to earn his living by being an attendant at various shows. He was emotionally devastated by the death of his wife and had find reconciliation in that job. He had a crush on Judy (Amanda Seyfried) who works at a gas station. And she also likes Eddie back. They go for their first date when she was going for her break between the job and Eddie joined her for a Coffee and which ended up in Eddie buying her food and was named a date. 

Everything was fine then, although Eddie was not financially strong. The famous talk show Stillermen show fortunately or unfortunately to Eddie, notices him being part of the audience in different shows. Since it was an interesting story to all, the news or the talk show went viral. Along with it went the job or Eddie, since he is recognized by people now and cannot become an ordinary audience. It turned his life and Judy's life upside down and at the end, he stops running faces the challenges and takes control.

The movie was a feel-good movie. There were some scenes that make one emotional like the one in which Eddie's mom attacks Stillerman. And he speaks about his life and how the show had affected his routine. There was another moment when Eddie tells about his past to Judy about his plans with his wife and how it went wrong due to the unanticipated death of his wife. Overall the film is a good one to watch though it lacks a good background.
